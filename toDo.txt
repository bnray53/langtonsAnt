Things To Do:

DONE-Configure so canvas is set automatically to device width
FIXED--Elements are currently responsive, but need to keep the number of block desplayed divisible by resolution
FIXED--Adjustment bars are currently not being removed upon resizing, need to reload page to clear.
FIXED--Need to be able to reset page, especially if ant has been placed already

Add writeup about the math behind the process
--Add instructions/how-to

DONE-Write some kind of horizontal control panel for adjusting and displpaying various parameters to replace the single paragraph cells
FIXED--Control Panel Added, need to configure the program to accept the new inputs.

???Add aditional pages for Mandlebrot Set, Cantor Set, Koch Lines, and Barnselys Fern???

???Have display for error message that are currently being logged to console??? 

DONE-Allow user control over speed of iterations

DONE-Have program stop when border has been reached

DONE-Add ability to place multiple ants

DONE-Optimize ant logic for speed. ?Instead of redrawing whole grid just redraw the flipped square?

DONE-Add ability to select and rotate ants

DONE-Add ability to start with random colored grid

Refactor and clean up program
--???Have classes, setup/draw, and startAnt in different folders???

???Remove click inside area warning???

???Add ability for ant to not go out of bounds but loop back to opposite edge, or bounce off of edge???

???let user control scale???
--do this with mouse scroll???

???hover over coordinates for replication???

DONE-save number of cycles

???save starting coordinates for replication???

DONE-Different colors for different ants

DONE-disable start button when startAnt is called to prevent skipping error

DONE-verify antPlaced flag is functioning
FIXED--error is occuring because ant is being placed outside of canvas when clicking start, this allows a user to prematuraly 
 start the StartAnt function
FIXED--Need to fix by adjusting the click event checking for the padding around the canvas.
//Fixed by changing diminsion check (mouseX < width && mouseY < height) to ((mouseX>0&&(mouseX<width))&&(mouseY>0&&(mouseY<height)))

bug user can set ants to two, place ants, reset ants to three click start, then place third ant.
--???Fix or Feature???

DONE-only change to cycleCount if ant has been placed
//Moved antStartedFlag inside if statement, garunteeing ants have been placed before switching 

DONE-Add "please place your ants" to cell5 when done with roate and select function implementation 

Clean up cell5 data
???put responsive icon here???
