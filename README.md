# langtonsAnt

### About
- Langton&apos;s Ant is based on the mathematical subset of Discrete Math related to Cellular Automatons.
- This application can be used to demonstrate Langton&apos;s Highway as pictured below, as well as a number of unique or random patterns that result from placing multiple ants and varying their starting direction.
- This application works by having the user pick a starting point for the ant/s and starting the simulation. The ant/s will then move left or right depending on the color of the grid it currently resides on. Left if it&apos;s on a black grid, right if it&apos;s on a white grid. The ant will then advance on grid in the chosen direction by one grid space and flip the color of the grid it just left. 

### Examples
- Below is an example of Langton&apos;s Highway plotted using Langton&apos;s Ant. Starting with just one ant after about 11,000 cycles a pattern will begin to emerge known as Langton&apos;s Highway.

- Below is an example of a symmetric pattern plotted using Langton&apos;s Ant with four starting ants.

### Live Demo

### How To
- Use the slider to select how many ants you want to place on the grid.
- Select "Zoom" button to cycle through different screen resolutions.
- Place your starting ant/s anywhere on the grid.
- You can select and rotate the ant/s with the appropriate buttons.
- If a random grid is preferred select the "Random Grid" button, to return to a solid grid select the "Solid Grid" button.
- Use the slider to select iteration speed, this can also be adjusted during the simulation at any time.
- Select the start button.
- You can pause and resume the simulation at any point by selecting the "Pause" button.
- The program will terminate when any ant goes outside of the grid.
- To reset the simulation select the reset button.
