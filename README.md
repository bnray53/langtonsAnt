### About
- Langton&apos;s Ant is based on the mathematical subset of Discrete Math related to Cellular Automatons.
- This application is best used to demonstrate Langton&apos;s Highway as pictured below.
- This application works by having the user pick a starting point for the ant and starting the simulation. The ant will then move left or right depending on the color of the grid he currently resides on. Left if he&apos;s on a black grid, right if he&apos;s on a white grid. He will advance on grid in the chosen direction and flip the color of the grid he just left. After about 11,000 cycles a pattern will begin to emerge known as Langton&apos;s Highway.

### Example
- Here&apos;s an example of Langton&apos;s Highway plotted using Langton&apos;s Ant

### How To
- Place your starting point anywhere on the canvas.
- Select cycle iteration speed with slider.
- Hit the start button.
- Adjust cycle iteration speed at any time during the simulation.
- To reset the simulation hit the reset button.
